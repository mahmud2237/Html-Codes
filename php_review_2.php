Great job! In this lesson, we learned all about using numbers in PHP. Let’s review what we covered:

PHP has two number data types: integers and floating point numbers
We can use arithmetic operators for performing math operations:
Operation: Example:
Addition + echo 1 + 4.5; // Prints: 5.5
Subtraction - echo 9 - 1; // Prints: 8
Multiplication * echo -1.9 * 2.9; // Prints: -5.51
Division / echo 9 / 1; // Prints: 9
Modulo % echo 11 % 3; // Prints: 2
Exponentiation ** echo 8**2; // Prints: 64

Operations have an order of precedence meaning that certain types of operations in a chain will be evaluated before others: first evaluated will be any operation wrapped in parenthesis (()), next exponents (**), then multiplication (*) and division (/), and finally addition (+) and subtraction (-). The acronym PEMDAS can be a helpful way of remembering the order.
We can assign number values to variables and then perform numerical operations with them.
We can use mathematical assignment operators as a shorthand when reassigning number variables:
Operation: Long Syntax: Short Syntax:
Add $x = $x + $y or, $x += $y
Subtract $x = $x - $y or, $x -= $y
Multiply $x = $x * $y or, $x *= $y
Divide $x = $x / $y or, $x /= $y
Mod $x = $x % $y or, $x %= $y
*/

$my_num = -19273645.862;

$answer = $my_num;

$answer += 2;

$answer *= 2;

$answer -= 2;

$answer /= 2;

$answer -= $my_num;

echo "Look! It still works!\n";

echo $answer;

echo "\nCool?\nIt's a little cool, right?";
?>
